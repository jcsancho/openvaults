# DeFi Simulation Example

## Notes

Make sure to set your archive node endpoint and private key in truffle-config.js! (Use your Truffle Teams mainnet fork info or archive node data)

Also, make sure you `npm install` before running this example

If you use an archive node that's not from Truffle, then your private key should point to an account that had funds at the block you specified as your forked block
